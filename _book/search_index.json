In cases where the manufacturer chooses to claim panel characteristics higher than the specification levels of AS/NZS?, with further reference to relevant specific product standards, the factory production control shall be carried out according to the characteristic levels claimed. Samples shall be drawn from each product type and thickness range. The production may be further subdivided, for example, by thickness. Procedures alternative to the standardised procedure (for example, unconditioned or in-line testing) may be used for the determination of panel characteristics, provided that a statistically significant relationship can be established between the specified characteristic and the measured characteristic. See de3tails in section 5.2.1/ Systematic differences arising from the use of alternative procedures shall be taken into account by individual correction factors which shall be determined by experiment. The correction factors shall be verified from time to time. 6.2 Sampling 6.2.1 General Sampling shall be carried out in accordance with the relevant AS/NZS specification. 6.2.2 Sample size The following tables give the required sample size (number of panels per batch) that are to be tested so as to achieve a desired probability of acceptance with a specified quality level (proportion of batch means above the lower or upper specification limit). 6.2.2.1 Estimated sd, No retesting, Acc Prob=0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 0.96 5 15 0.97 2 4 8 13 21 0.98 2 3 4 5 8 12 17 25 0.99 2 2 2 3 4 5 7 10 16 0.995 2 2 2 2 3 4 5 6 9 6.2.2.2 Rolling sd, No retesting, Acc Prob=0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 0.96 9 15 0.97 5 6 8 11 18 0.98 3 4 4 5 6 9 12 21 0.99 3 3 3 3 4 4 5 7 10 0.995 2 2 3 3 3 3 3 4 6 6.2.2.3 Known sd, No retesting, Acc Prob=0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9 0.95 0.96 2 6 14 25 0.97 1 2 3 5 9 13 20 30 0.98 1 1 1 2 3 5 7 10 17 0.99 1 1 1 1 1 2 3 4 6 0.995 1 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 4 The current quality level can be calculated as \\[\\Phi \\left( \\frac{{\\bar{x}-L}}{\\sigma_B}\\right)\\] where \\(\\Phi()\\) is the cumulative Normal distribition, \\(\\bar{\\bar{x}}\\) is the process mean, \\(L\\) is the Lower Specification limit, and \\(\\sigma_B\\) is the between panel standard deviation. Samples should be selected at random. This can be achieved from a continuous process by randomising the sample cutting pattern. In a multi-daylight process daylight selection and location within the daylight/board should be randomised. 6.3 Control of production 6.3.1 General For assessing compliance of a product by variables the following methods shall be used: Factory production control by variables for batch production according to 6.3.2, or Internal records of an established product according to 6.3.4. 6.3.2 Factory production control by variables for batch production In order to evaluate the compliance of the last batch production with the requirements of AS/NZS standards, with further reference to other relevant specific product standards, the manufacturer shall use the following procedure unless alternative procedures are adopted giving at least the same level of confidence. 6.3.2.1 Batch factory production control where no retesting is carried out To establish the conformity of the panels with the requirements, estimates shall be calculated of the lower \\(_{1}L_{x}\\), or upper \\(_{1}U_{x}\\) confidence limit, respectively, for the production period, according to Equations (17) and (18), respectively: \\[_{1}L_{x} = \\bar{x} - k_{n}\\times {s}_{\\bar{x}}\\] (17) or \\[_{1}U_{x} = \\bar{x} - k_{n}\\times {s}_{\\bar{x}}\\] (18) where \\(n\\) is the number of panels sampled. The \\(k_{n}\\)-values in relation to the number panels sampled are given in the table below. If \\(_1L_x\\) is equal to or greater than the lower specification limit \\(L\\), or if \\(_1U_x\\) is equal to or less than the upper specification limit \\(U\\), respectively, the panel characteristics shall be considered to be in conformity with the requirements. If the requirements are not met, the panels of the respective production period shall be down-graded. Sample Size Estimated Std.Dev Rolling Std. Dev Known Std.

If the requirements are not met, a further set of panels shall be sampled with the same sample size.

In most cases it would be desirable to sample and test during the production run. In that case, different k factors can be used. At the beginning of the run, the planned sample size needs to be specified. As regular intervals during the run, a panel is sampled and tested. To establish the conformity of the panels with the requirements, estimates shall be calculated of the lower \\(_{1}L_{x}\\), or upper \\(_{1}U_{x}\\) confidence limit, respectively, for the immediately preceeding production period, respectively: \\[_{1}L_{x} = \\bar{x} - k_{p}\\times \\bar{s}_{r}\\] or \\[_{1}U_{x} = \\bar{x} - k_{p}\\times \\bar{s}_{r}\\] where: the \\(p\\) is the number of panels which are planned to be sampled during the run, and \\(\\bar{s}_{r}\\) is the rolling standard deviation based on the last 30 panel means. If the criteria above are satisfied (with retesting if allowed), then production can continue, while if the criteria are not satisfied, then the immediately preceding production should be downgraded. Note: If a data point from a sample is suspected to be an outlier a Grubbs test should be carried out and if the result of the test identifies the data point as an outlier it should be discarded and a new sample taken. The k factors are chosen so that the probability of acceptance of the entire run at the 5th percentile is set to 0.5 for all parameters. The k factors are given in the table below. Note that the k factors are negative when retesting is not allowed and the planned sample size is greater than 13 panels when the acceptance probability is 0.5, and the planned sample size is greater than 27 panels when the acceptance probability is 0.25.

Instead, a simple updating formula can be used. Assume that the last 30 panel means are, in production order, given by \\(x_0, x_1, \\ldots, x_{29}\\), with grand mean \\(\\bar{\\bar{x}}_{O}\\) and standard deviation \\(s_O\\). When an additional panel mean, \\(x_{30}\\) is available, the first panel mean, \\(x_0\\) is discarded and the new panel mean, \\(x_{30}\\) is added to the calculations to give a new grand mean \\(\\bar{\\bar{x}}_{N}\\) with standard deviation \\(s_N\\). This can be calculated using Equations (1) and (2), or by the updating formalae \\[\\bar{\\bar{x}}_{N}=\\bar{\\bar{x}}_{O}+\\frac{x_{30}-x_0}{30}\\] and \\[s_N=\\sqrt{s_O^2+\\frac{(x_{30}-x_0)(x_{30}-\\bar{\\bar{x}}_{N}+x_0-\\bar{\\bar{x}}_{O})}{29}}.\\] 6.4.0.2 Metod of establishing and monitoring the known standard deviation Monitoring of the statistical control of the standard deviation is desirable. If the process is in control then the known standard deviation k values can be used. For each bath the grand mean of the panel means, \\(\\bar{\\bar{x}}\\) should be calculated, as well as the standard deviation of the of the panel means, \\(s_{\\bar{x}}\\). An overall average standard deviation should be calculated. This should be the square root of the average squared standard deviation of the panel means, weighted by the number of sampled panels in the batch minus 1, i.e. \\[\\bar{s}=\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum((n_b-1)s_{\\bar{x}}^2}{\\sum((n_b-1)}}.\\] At least 30-40 batches should be included in the calculation of \\(\\bar{s}\\) and the value should be reviewed/updated from time to time (e.g. monthly). To monitor the standard deviation, an s control chart should be used. The standard deviation of the panel means should be plotted against the batch number. The lower control limit is given by \\[\\mbox{LCL} = c_{n_b} \\times \\bar{s},\\] while the upper control limit is given by \\[\\mbox{UCL} = d_{n_b} \\times \\bar{s},\\] with tables of \\(c_{n_b}\\) and \\(d_{n_b}\\) are given below, where \\(n_b\\) is the number of panels sampled per batch. \\(n_b\\) \\(c_{n_b}\\) \\(d_{n_b}\\) 2 0.002 3.205 3 0.037 2.571 4 0.1 2.283 5 0.163 2.11 6 0.218 1.991 7 0.266 1.903 8 0.306 1.835 9 0.341 1.78 10 0.371 1.735 11 0.398 1.697 12 0.422 1.664 13 0.443 1.635 14 0.461 1.609 15 0.479 1.587 16 0.494 1.566 17 0.508 1.548 18 0.522 1.531 19 0.534 1.516 20 0.545 1.502 21 0.555 1.489 22 0.565 1.477 23 0.574 1.466 24 0.583 1.456 25 0.591 1.446 26 0.599 1.437 27 0.606 1.428 28 0.613 1.42 29 0.619 1.412 30 0.625 1.405 Note that the LCL and UCL depend on the number of panels sampled per batch and if these vary then so do the control limits. Also note that the control limits have nothing to do with the specification limits. Values of the standard deviation outside the limits indicate that the process is out of statistical control and adjustments to the process must be made. 6.4.0.3 Standardised Control Chart It may be desirable to standardize the control chart for ease of reviwing it. This can be done in the following way: If \\(G_{n_b-1}(x)\\) is the cumulative distribution of the chi-square distribution with \\(n_b-1\\) degrees of freedom, and \\(\\Phi^{-1}(p)\\) is the inverse Normal distribution, then a standardised control chart can be made by transforming the standard deviations using the transformation \\[h(s)=\\Phi^{-1}\\left(G_{n_b-1}\\left( \\frac{(n_b-1)s^2_b}{\\bar{s}^2}\\right) \\right)\\] with \\(LCL=-3\\) and \\(UCL=3\\). 6.4.0.4 Setting a process mean value It may be useful to establish target values for the process mean to aid in factory process control. For an individual factory the targeted process mean value of a property shall be calculated in accordance with the following equations: \\[ PV_L = L +K_T \\sigma_B\\] \\[ PV_U = U -K_T \\sigma_B\\] where \\(\\sigma_B\\) is the standard deviation between panel means and \\(K_T\\) depends on the target quality as follows: Target Quality \\(K_T\\) 0.96 1.751 0.97 1.881 0.98 2.053 0.99 2.326 0.995 2.576 "]
