## Example 1, Initial type testing, Estimated Standard Deviation.

Single sampling with 16 mm IB, Lower Specification is 0.3 Mpa. 12 panels were randomly selected and four tests were conducted per panel. The results and the calculated panel means are given in the table below.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
library(pander)
set.seed(200592)
library(xtable)
xmat <- matrix(round(rnorm(48,0.43,0.050),2),12,4)
xmat1 <- matrix(round(rep(rnorm(12,0,0.070),each=4),2),12,4,byrow=T)
xmat2 <- xmat+xmat1


for (i in 1:12){
  eval(parse(text=paste0("m",i,"<- mean(xmat2[",i,",])")))
}


tabmat <- cbind(xmat2,c(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8,m9,m10,m11,m12))
colnames(tabmat) <- c("1","2","3,","4","panel mean")
#print(xtable(tabmat, digits=3),caption="Example 1",align=rep("c",6),caption.placement="top",
#      include.rownames=F, type="html")
pander(tabmat)

m <- round(mean(c(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8,m9,m10,m11,m12)),3)
s <- round(sd(c(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8,m9,m10,m11,m12)),3)
l <- round(m-1.6912*s,3)

```


The grand mean is given by `r m` while the standard deviation between panel means is given by `r s`. The 5% comparison value is then
$$`r m`-1.691 \times `r s` = `r l`$$ which is less than 0.30 Mpa, and hence the initital type testing is not achieved.

## Example 2, Initial type testing, Estimated Standard Deviation.

Single sampling with 16 mm IB, Lower Specification is 0.3 Mpa. 12 panels were randomly selected and four tests were conducted per panel. The results and the calculated panel means are given in the table below.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
library(xtable)
xmat <- matrix(round(rnorm(48,0.53,0.050),2),12,4)
xmat1 <- matrix(round(rep(rnorm(12,0,0.070),each=4),2),12,4,byrow=T)
xmat2 <- xmat+xmat1


for (i in 1:12){
  eval(parse(text=paste0("m",i,"<- mean(xmat2[",i,",])")))
}


tabmat <- cbind(xmat2,c(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8,m9,m10,m11,m12))
colnames(tabmat) <- c("1","2","3,","4","panel mean")
#print(xtable(tabmat, digits=3),caption="Example 1",align=rep("c",6),caption.placement="top",
#      include.rownames=F, type="html")
pander(tabmat)

m <- round(mean(c(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8,m9,m10,m11,m12)),3)
s <- round(sd(c(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5,m6,m7,m8,m9,m10,m11,m12)),3)
l <- round(m-1.6912*s,3)

```


The grand mean is given by `r m` while the standard deviation between panel means is given by `r s`. The 5% comparison value is then
$$`r m`-1.691 \times `r s` = `r l`$$ which is greater than 0.30 Mpa, and hence the initital type testing is achieved.



## Example 3, Single sampling, Estimated Standard Deviation (Fails).


Single sampling with 18 mm MOR, Lower Specification is 12 Mpa. Three panels were randomly selected and four tests were conducted per panel. The results and the calculated panel means are given in the table below.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
set.seed(200592)
library(xtable)
xmat <- matrix(round(rnorm(12,15.74,1.97),1),3,4)
xmat1 <- matrix(round(rep(rnorm(3,0,1.36),each=4),1),3,4,byrow=T)
xmat2 <- xmat+xmat1
m1 <- mean(xmat2[1,])
m2 <- mean(xmat2[2,])
m3 <- mean(xmat2[3,])
tabmat <- cbind(xmat2,c(m1,m2,m3))
colnames(tabmat) <- c("1","2","3,","4","panel mean")
#print(xtable(tabmat, digits=3),caption="Example 1",align=rep("c",6),caption.placement="top",
#      include.rownames=F, type="html")
pander(tabmat)

m4 <- round(mean(c(m1,m2,m3)),3)
s4 <- round(sd(c(m1,m2,m3)),3)
l4 <- round(m4-1.939*s4,3)

```


The grand mean is given by \[\frac{`r m1`+`r m2` + `r m3`}{3}=`r m4`\]  while the standard deviation between panel means is given by \[\sqrt{\frac{(`r m1` - `r m4`)^2 + (`r m2` - `r m4`)^2 + (`r m3` - `r m4`)^2}{2}}=`r s4`.\] The 5% comparison value is then
$$`r m4`-1.939 \times `r s4` = `r l4`$$ which is less than 12 Mpa, and hence the specification limit is not achieved.

## Example 4, Single sampling, Estimated Standard Deviation (Passes).

Single sampling with 18 mm MOR, Lower Specification is 12 Mpa. Three panels were randomly selected and four tests were conducted per panel. The results and the calculated panel means are given in the table below.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
library(xtable)
xmat <- matrix(round(rnorm(12,18.74,1.97),1),3,4)
xmat1 <- matrix(round(rep(rnorm(3,0,1.36),each=4),1),3,4,byrow=T)
xmat2 <- xmat+xmat1
m1 <- mean(xmat2[1,])
m2 <- mean(xmat2[2,])
m3 <- mean(xmat2[3,])
tabmat <- cbind(xmat2,c(m1,m2,m3))
colnames(tabmat) <- c("1","2","3,","4","panel mean")
#print(xtable(tabmat, digits=3),caption="Example 1",align=rep("c",6),caption.placement="top",
#      include.rownames=F, type="html")
pander(tabmat)

m4 <- round(mean(c(m1,m2,m3)),3)
s4 <- round(sd(c(m1,m2,m3)),3)
l4 <- round(m4-1.939*s4,3)

```


The grand mean is given by \[\frac{`r m1`+`r m2` + `r m3`}{3}=`r m4`\] while the standard deviation between panel means is given by \[\sqrt{\frac{(`r m1` - `r m4`)^2 + (`r m2` - `r m4`)^2 + (`r m3` - `r m4`)^2}{2}}=`r s4`.\] The 5% comparison value is then
$$`r m4`-1.939 \times `r s4` = `r l4`$$ which is greater than 12 Mpa, and hence the specification limit is achieved.

## Example 5, Single sampling, Known Standard Deviation (Passes).

Single sampling with 18 mm MOR, Lower Specification is 12 Mpa. The long run standard deviation is 1.680. Three panels were randomly selected and four tests were conducted per panel. The results and the calculated panel means are given in the table below.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
library(xtable)
xmat <- matrix(round(rnorm(12,16.74,1.97),1),3,4)
xmat1 <- matrix(round(rep(rnorm(3,0,1.36),each=4),1),3,4,byrow=T)
xmat2 <- xmat+xmat1
m1 <- mean(xmat2[1,])
m2 <- mean(xmat2[2,])
m3 <- mean(xmat2[3,])
tabmat <- cbind(xmat2,c(m1,m2,m3))
colnames(tabmat) <- c("1","2","3,","4","panel mean")
#print(xtable(tabmat, digits=3),caption="Example 1",align=rep("c",6),caption.placement="top",
#      include.rownames=F, type="html")
pander(tabmat)

m4 <- round(mean(c(m1,m2,m3)),3)
l4 <- round(m4-1.645*1.680,3)


```


The grand mean is given by \[\frac{`r m1`+`r m2` + `r m3`}{3}=`r m4`\] The 5% comparison value is then
$$`r m4`-1.645 \times 1.680 = `r l4`$$ which is greater than 12 Mpa, and hence the specification limit is achieved.

## Example 6, Single sampling, Known Standard Deviation (Fails).

Single sampling with 18 mm MOR, Lower Specification is 12 Mpa. The long run standard deviation is 1.680. Three panels were randomly selected and four tests were conducted per panel. The results and the calculated panel means are given in the table below.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}

xmat <- matrix(round(rnorm(12,13.74,1.97),1),3,4)
xmat1 <- matrix(round(rep(rnorm(3,0,1.36),each=4),1),3,4,byrow=T)
xmat2 <- xmat+xmat1
m1 <- mean(xmat2[1,])
m2 <- mean(xmat2[2,])
m3 <- mean(xmat2[3,])
tabmat <- cbind(xmat2,c(m1,m2,m3))

pander(tabmat)

m4 <- round(mean(c(m1,m2,m3)),3)
l4 <- round(m4-1.645*1.680,3)


```


The grand mean is given by \[\frac{`r m1`+`r m2` + `r m3`}{3}=`r m4`\] The 5% comparison value is then
$$`r m4`-1.645 \times 1.680 = `r l4`$$ which is less than 12 Mpa, and hence the specification limit is not achieved.

## Example 7, Retesting, Estimated Standard Deviation (Passes on first round).

Single sampling with 25 mm IB, Lower Specification is 0.25 Mpa. Five panels were randomly selected and four tests were conducted per panel. The results and the calculated panel means are given in the table below.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
library(xtable)
xmat <- matrix(round(rnorm(5,0.57,0.06),2),5,4)

m2 <- mean(xmat2[2,])
m3 <- mean(xmat2[3,])
m4 <- mean(xmat2[4,])
m5 <- mean(xmat2[5,])
tabmat <- cbind(xmat2,c(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5))
colnames(tabmat) <- c("1","2","3,","4","panel mean")
#print(xtable(tabmat, digits=3),caption="Example 1",align=rep("c",6),caption.placement="top",
#      include.rownames=F, type="html")
pander(tabmat)

m <- round(mean(c(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5)),3)
s <- round(sd(c(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5)),3)
l <- round(m4-1.960*s,3)

```


The grand mean is given by \[\frac{`r m1`+`r m2` + `r m3` + `r m4` + `r m5`}{5}=`r m`\] while the standard deviation between panel means is given by \[\sqrt{\frac{(`r m1` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m2` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m3` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m4` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m5` - `r m`)^2}{4}}=`r s`.\] The 5% comparison value is then
$$`r m`-1.960 \times `r s` = `r l`$$ which is greater than 0.25 Mpa, and hence the specification limit is achieved.

## Example 8, Retesting, Estimated Standard Deviation (Fails first round, Passses on second round).

Single sampling with 25 mm IB, Lower Specification is 0.25 Mpa. Five panels were randomly selected and four tests were conducted per panel. The results and the calculated panel means are given in the table below.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}

```


The grand mean is given by \[\frac{`r m1`+`r m2` + `r m3` + `r m4` + `r m5`}{5}=`r m`\] while the standard deviation between panel means is given by \[\sqrt{\frac{(`r m1` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m2` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m3` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m4` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m5` - `r m`)^2}{4}}=`r s`.\] The 5% comparison value is then
$$`r m`-1.960 \times `r s` = `r l`$$ which is less than 0.25 Mpa, and hence the specification limit is not achieved. An additional five panels were sampled, with four tests per sample.

```

The mean of the second set of tests is given by \[\frac{`r m1` + `r m2` + `r m3` + `r m4` + `r m5`}{5} = `r m2nd`\]
while the standard deviation of the second set of tests is given by \[\sqrt{\frac{(`r m1` - `r m2nd`)^2 + (`r m2` - `r m2nd`)^2 + (`r m3` - `r m2nd`)^2 + (`r m4` - `r m2nd`)^2 + (`r m5` - `r m2nd`)^2}{4}}=`r s2nd`.\]
The new grand mean is therefore given by \[\frac{`r m` + `r m2nd`}{2} = `r mcomb`\] while the pooled standard deviation for the two tests is give by \[\sqrt{\frac{`r s^2` + `r s2nd^2`}{2}} = `r pooleds`\]



The grand mean is now given by `r mcomb` while the pooled standard deviation between panel means is given by `r pooleds`. The 5% comparison value is then
$$`r mcomb`-1.960 \times `r pooleds` = `r l`$$ which is greater than 0.25 Mpa, and hence the specification limit is achieved. 

## Example 9, Retesting, Estimated Standard Deviation (Fails both rounds).

pooleds <- 0.085
l <- round(mcomb-1.758*pooleds,3)

```

The  mean of the second set of tests is given by \[\frac{`r m1` + `r m2` + `r m3` + `r m4` + `r m5`}{5} = `r m2nd`\]

The new grand mean is therefore given by \[\frac{`r m` + `r m2nd`}{2} = `r mcomb`\] while the standard deviation remains as `r pooleds`. 


The grand mean is now given by `r mcomb` while the pooled standard deviation between panel means is given by `r pooleds`. The 5% comparison value is then
$$`r mcomb`-1.758 \times `r pooleds` = `r l`$$ which is greater than 0.35 Mpa, and hence the specification limit is achieved. 

## Example 12, Retesting, Known Standard Deviation (Fails both rounds).

Double sampling with 12 mm IB, Lower Specification is 0.35 Mpa. The long run standard deviation is 0.085. Five panels were randomly selected and four tests were conducted per panel. The results and the calculated panel means are given in the table below.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}
library(xtable)
xmat <- matrix(round(rnorm(5,0.36,0.06),2),5,4)

m2 <- mean(xmat2[2,])
m3 <- mean(xmat2[3,])

m <- round(mean(c(m1,m2,m3,m4,m5)),3)
s <- 0.085
l <- round(m-1.758*s,3)

```


The grand mean is given by \[\frac{`r m1`+`r m2` + `r m3` + `r m4` + `r m5`}{5}=`r m`\] while the standard deviation between panel means is given by \[\sqrt{\frac{(`r m1` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m2` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m3` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m4` - `r m`)^2 + (`r m5` - `r m`)^2}{4}}=`r s`.\] The 5% comparison value is then
$$`r m`-1.758 \times `r s` = `r l`$$ which is less than 0.35 Mpa, and hence the specification limit is not achieved. An additional five panels were sampled, with four tests per sample.

The  mean of the second set of tests is given by \[\frac{`r m1` + `r m2` + `r m3` + `r m4` + `r m5`}{5} = `r m2nd`\]

The new grand mean is therefore given by \[\frac{`r m` + `r m2nd`}{2} = `r mcomb`\] while the standard deviation remains as `r pooleds`. 





The grand mean is now given by `r mcomb` while the pooled standard deviation between panel means is given by `r pooleds`. The 5% comparison value is then

##Example 13, Rolling Std Deviation and Continuous Testing

Using rolling std deviation with 16 mm IB, Lower Specification is 0.30 Mpa. Four samples are planned during the production run with four tests per board and retesting is allowed. The $k$ value is 1.127. The table below gives the last 30 test panels for this product, with corresponding panel means.

```{r, results='asis', echo=FALSE}

the standard criteria is achieved and the production can proceed.

The updated mean is

Since \[`r tabmat4[1,5]`-1.127\times`r gs3`=`r compval4`<0.30,\]
the standard criteria is not achieved and another panel needs to be tested.

the standard criteria is achieved and the production does not need to be downgraded.

Two sets of updates need to be applied.
